    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

## Usage

```javascript
import zeros3d from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/array-base-zeros3d@v0.2.3-esm/index.mjs';
```

#### zeros3d( shape )

Returns a zero-filled three-dimensional nested array.

```javascript
var out = zeros3d( [ 1, 2, 3 ] );
// returns [ [ [ 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 ], [ 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 ] ] ]
